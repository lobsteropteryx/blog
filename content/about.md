Software engineer, interested in testing, automation, and quality; I've done a lot of work applying XP techniques in areas where manual processes are still very common, including GIS, OLAP databases, and reporting.

I'm available for consulting contracts, or just to [chat](https://twitter.com/lobsteropteryx); if you're wrestling with a difficult and interesting problem, hit me up!

All opinions expressed here are my own, and YMMV.
