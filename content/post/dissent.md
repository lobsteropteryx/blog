I was thinking this morning* that one of the most difficult, but important things that leaders sometimes need to say is "now is not the time for dissenton this topic."

That's probably unpopular; in fact, I think there's a bit of a stigma against the idea.  And of course, there are almost certainly folks out there using that phrase as an escape hatch for all kinds of things, or using it to make sure that there's never a time for dissent.  I think it evokes more than the words actually say, so maybe there's a better way to put it.  It ultimately comes down, in my mind, to transparency.  Essentially I'd just like folks to come out and say the words, when they feel that they're true.

"I hear you, and I even agree with you, but I think that..." 

People often raise concerns to their manager, and a good manager will do what they can to help address those concerns.  But I don't think we always do a good job being forthright in those conversations, and being clear about when it's unlikely that a concern can or will be addressed.

* I'm renovating the bathroom in my house, so I don't have "shower thoughts" at the moment.  This is more of an "outhouse thought."  Adjust expectations accordingly.
