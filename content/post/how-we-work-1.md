A few thoughts about common patterns I've used successfully with distributed teams.

## Visualizing Work 

When it comes to tracking work, I always go back the original idea of notecards on a wall.  On a colocated team, we'd be laying out a few columns on the wall with masking tape, writing in sharpie on the back of 3x5 notecards, taping them to the wall, and _that would be it._  So when it comes to an electronic version of a card wall, I don't want conversations to be captured on cards, I don't need notifications, I don't want automatic numbering systems or fancy workflows.  I have tried a lot of systems over the years, and my tool of choice for distributed teams has been and remains [Trello](https://trello.com).  Every single time I've wished for some feature of Jira, Rally, Redbooth, or Asana, I've found a place where my process was overcomplicated, wasteful, or otherwise broken.

## Columns that don't represent states of work

I take a very narrow view of the purpose of an electronic card wall:  It is there to visualize the flow of work.  This means that columns on a board are states that a card flows through, from left to right.  One trap I've seen people fall into with electronic card walls is overloading them for other uses.  So you might end up with columns that represent risks, questions that come up, or other groupings that don't represent a stage of work.  If you have columns on your board that cards never pass through on their way to being completed, I recommend that you get rid of them--move them into their own board, a different tool, or just delete them.

## Which columns should I use?

One of the main purposes of using a board is to help identify bottlenecks in the flow of work.  To start off, each column on your board might represent a place in your value stream where work accumulates.  If a card needs to go through a Three Amigos workshop before development, or a code review before deployment, columns for `Three Amigos` or `Code Review` might be appropriate.  Likewise if  


The typical layout I like to use is very simple:  `To Do`, `Doing`, `Done`, and sometimes `Demo'd`.  `To Do` represents our backlog, and contains a few days worth of work.  `Doing` is our work in process, and usually contains a single card.  `Done` is for work that has made it into production, or the hands of end users.  The `Demo'd` column is sometimes used when we have regular, scheduled demos to stakeholders outside of the immediate team.
