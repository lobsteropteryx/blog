For most of my 20 years as a software engineer, I have avoided working for "tech" companies, and especially the VC-funded, silicon valley variety.  I didn't start out intentionally avoiding them; it just happened that I had somewhat of a non-traditional background, and it was easier to get my foot in the door writing software for companies whose main value proposition was only tangentially connected to software.  This tended to also mean companies who were a bit late to the party, and were trying to play catch-up.

A good chunk of my career was spent as a consultant, so I got to work with a lot of different organizations--small businesses and huge enterprises, across a number of industries; state and local government organizations; and some federal groups as well.  

In that "enterprisey" world, there has been a lot of talk and emphasis on "digital transformation," "product thinking," and good engineering and quality practices.  In my opinion, there was a real feeling of, "We are behind the curve, and need to catch up with all those tech unicorns."  And there was certainly some validity to that; I've seen many, many organizations with critical software and infrastructure without things like source control, automated testing, repeatable deployments, or even consistent code formatting. And there have been many times that I longed to work for a more "modern" organization; I got tired of having to fight for what I thought were clear and established practices.

Eventually I ended up working with an absolutely fantastic organization.  A non-tech company, who had brought in some *really* good engineering consultants, then hired them, then promoted them.
