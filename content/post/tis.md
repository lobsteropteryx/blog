Look at any modern application, ETL process, or data analysis, and you're likely to find a [textual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textuality) component. While the ubiquity and value of textual information is clear, working with text requires specialized training and knowledge that often fall outside the realm of traditional developers and analysts.  The power and insight that can be gained from textual data coupled with the unique skills needed have led to an explosion of demand in the text industry.

There is a great deal of complexity inherent in textual [data types](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd374131(v=vs.85).aspx), and although there has been a tremendous amount of progress made towards standardization, there are still significant differences--for example, most database management systems still have their own [quirks](http://dba-presents.com/index.php/databases/sql-server/80-string-functions-sql-server-oracle-mysql-differences) and [vendor specific implementations](http://www.vertabelo.com/blog/technical-articles/comparing-char-and-varchar-data-types-in-different-database-engines) for text types.

There are also many [specialized algorithms](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~rytter/BOOKS/text-algorithms.pdf) that are needed when working with textual data.  While a layman may think that "text is text", a textual specialist will understand that there are [many different ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding) to represent the same text, and can help you pick the correct one for your particular application.

Almost every business problem has a textual component, even if it's not immediately apparent, and while the general principles of these data structures and algorithms have been well understood for [quite some time](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), the complexities that crop up require specific training and specialization to master.  Fortunately there are many knowledgeable experts in the field that are passionate about finding textual solutions to fit your organization's needs.
